# Study-Power-Visualiser
Simple tool for planning the power of a clinical trial with a continuous (quantitative) endpoint. Users can define alpha (probability of a false positive), variability (standard deviation) and the number of patients. The app uses visualisation to show the distribution under null and alternative hypotheses.
